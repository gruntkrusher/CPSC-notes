ADTs - Abstract Data Types
  * a way of looking at data structures focusing on what it does and ignoring how it does he job
  * "a class considered wihtout regard to its implementation"
 
 Arrays
  * contiguous blocks of memory for homogeneous array (all elements are the same type)
  * Multidimensional
    - row-major or column-major order
    - array of arrays
  * As a data structure we usually want no empty cells (v. sparse arrays)
  * Algorithms
    - Insert
      + constant time
    - Search/Find
      + linear time
    - Delete
      + linear time 
    - Duplicates?
      + not much changes
      
  * Ordered Array
    - sores values in key sequence
    insert - find loc and move all others up
    delete - find loc and move all others down
    - insert is more expensive
    - delete is easier
    search - linear, as before, or...
     Binary Search - very powerful

  * Often
    - Best case: Sorted
    - Worst case: Reverse Sorted
    - Average case: Random
