  * Multidimensional
    - row-major or column-major order
    - array of arrays
  * As a data structure we usually want no empty cells (v. sparse arrays)
  * Algorithms
    - Insert
      + constant time
    - Search/Find
      + linear time
    - Delete
      + linear time 
    - Duplicates?
      + not much changes
