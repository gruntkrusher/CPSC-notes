Linked lists can be made using a set of two arrays
    one for tracking what index of the first comes next
    [12,23,13]  Values
    [2,-1,1] References
    12 -> 13 -> 23 -> end
  Flaw - requires your own memory management
    can be accomplished with a stack of empty indices

As objects
  each object has some data and pointer/reference to the next object in the list
    deleting an item becomes easy - assign the deleted object's next to the object before it
      The deleted object will have no references to it and will be garbage collected
