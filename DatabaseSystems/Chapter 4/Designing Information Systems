Designing Information Systems

5 components - Hardware, Software, Data, Procedures, People
  
Business Process - a set of activities that transforms inputs into outputs
  - withdrawl money from an ATM
  - opening a bank account with an employee

Business Process Modeling - The study and documentation of business processes
  
  **System Definition - The system definition step isa process that starts with 
    the need for an information system to support a business process as its input,
    and produces a project plan as its output.
    
    During this process, we need to:
      Define goals and scope
      Assess project feasibility (Technical, Economic, Organizational)
      Form the project team
      Plan the project
  
  **Requirements Analysis Step - The requirements analysis step is a process that
    starts with the project plan as its input, and produces a set of approved user
    requirements as its output.
    
    During this step we need to:
      Conduct user interviews
      Evaluate existing systems
      Determine needed new forms/reports/queries
      Identify needed new application features and functions 
      consider security
      Create the data model
      Consider the five componenets of an information system
        hardware, software, data, procedures, and people
    
    Delivers:
      Data models
      User requirements document
      Statement of Work
    
  **Component Design Step - The component design step is a process that starts with 
    the approved user requirements as its input, and produces a final system design 
    as its output
  
    During this step we need to:
      Determine hardware specifications
      Determine program specifications
