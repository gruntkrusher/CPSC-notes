# Database Systems Ch2

Characteristics of relation
- Rows contain data about single entity
- Columns contain data about attributes of the entity
- Cells of the table hold a single value
- All entries in a oclumn are of the smae kind
- Each oclumn has a unique name
- The order of the columns is unimportant
- The order of the rows is unimportant
- No two rows may be identical

Presenting Relation Structures
  RELATION_NAME( Column01, Column02, ... , LastColumn)
  ex. EMPLOYEE(EmployeeNumber, FirstName, LastName, Department, Email, Phone)
  
  database schema - the design on which a database and it associated applications are built
 
Terminology
  -Synonyms
    Table = File = Relation
    Row = Record = Tuple
    Column = Field = Attribute
    
Types of Keys
  key - a key is one [or more] column[s] of a relation that is [are] used to identify a row
  
  unique key - a unique value is used for each entry [EmployeeNumber]
  non-unique key - key value may repeat between entries [LastName]
  
  composite key - a key that contains two or more attributes [LastName, FirstName]
      - may be unique if combination of keys does not appear more than once
          ex. if Employee 27, John May, is the only John May in the database it is a unique key for Employee 27
          
  candidate keys - keys that uniquely identify each row in a relation
  
**primary key - a candidate key chosen to be the main key for the relation
      - if you know the vlaue of the primary key, you will be able to uniquely identify a single row
      - primary keys are underlined in relation structure diagrams
      
  surrogate key - a unique, numeric value that is added to a relation to serve as the primary key
      - have no meaning to the user and are usually hidden on forms, queries, and reports
      - often used to replace composite primary keys
      
  foreign key - a primary key from one table placed into another table
      - Referential Integrity - every value of a foreign key must match a value of an existing primary key
