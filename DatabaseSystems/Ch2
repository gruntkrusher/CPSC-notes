# Database Systems Ch2

Characteristics of relation
- Rows contain data about single entity
- Columns contain data about attributes of the entity
- Cells of the table hold a single value
- All entries in a oclumn are of the smae kind
- Each oclumn has a unique name
- The order of the columns is unimportant
- The order of the rows is unimportant
- No two rows may be identical

Presenting Relation Structures
  RELATION_NAME( Column01, Column02, ... , LastColumn)
  ex. EMPLOYEE(EmployeeNumber, FirstName, LastName, Department, Email, Phone)
  
  database schema - the design on which a database and it associated applications are built
 
Terminology
  -Synonyms
    Table = File = Relation
    Row = Record = Tuple
    Column = Field = Attribute
    
Types of Keys
  key - a key is one [or more] column[s] of a relation that is [are] used to identify a row
  
  unique key - a unique value is used for each entry [EmployeeNumber]
  non-unique key - key value may repeat between entries [LastName]
  
  composite key - a key that contains two or more attributes [LastName, FirstName]
      - may be unique if combination of keys does not appear more than once
          ex. if Employee 27, John May, is the only John May in the database it is a unique key for Employee 27
          
  candidate keys - keys that uniquely identify each row in a relation
  
**primary key - a candidate key chosen to be the main key for the relation
      - if you know the vlaue of the primary key, you will be able to uniquely identify a single row
      - primary keys are underlined in relation structure diagrams
      
  surrogate key - a unique, numeric value that is added to a relation to serve as the primary key
      - have no meaning to the user and are usually hidden on forms, queries, and reports
      - often used to replace composite primary keys
      
  foreign key - a primary key from one table placed into another table
      - Referential Integrity - every value of a foreign key must match a value of an existing primary key
  
The Problem of Null Values
  * A Null if ofen ambiguous. It could mean...
    - The column value is not appropriate for the specific row
    - the column value is not decided
    - the column value is unknown
    
Functional Dependency
  * A relationship between attributes in which one attribute (or group of attributes) determines the value
    of another attribute in the same table
  * Relation
    - OBJECT (ObjectColor, Weight, Shape) [ObjectColor is underlined]
    
First Normal Form (1NF)
  * A table is on the first normal form if it satisfies the following conditions:
      - Contains only atomic values
      - There are no repeating groups/fields
Second Normal Form (2NF)
  * A table is on the second normal form if it satisfies the following conditions:
      - It is in the first normal form
      - all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key ( In other
          words, non-key attributes are determined by the entire primary key)
  * This means that if the primary key is a composite key, no non-key attribute can be determined
      by an attribute or attributes that make up only part of the key
      - Sometimes fileds depend on only part of the primary key, and these fields belong in another table

Normalization Process - Boyce-Codd Normal Form
    * Identify all the candidate keys of the relation.
    * Identify all the functional dependencies in the relation.
    * Examine the determinants of the functional dependencies. If any determinant 
      is not a candidate key, the relation is not well formed. In this case:
        - Place the columns of the functional dependency in a new relation of their own.
        - Make the determinant of the functional dependency the primary key of the new relation.
        - Leave a copy of the determinant as a foreign key in the original relation.
        - Create a referential integrity constraint between the original relation and the new relation.
    * Repeat step 3 as many times as necessary until every determinant of every relation is
      a candidate key.

BCNF Use Example:
 
    R (A,B,C,D)
      A   -> B,C,D
      B,C -> A,D
      D   -> B

    Since D is not a candidate key, we move it to a new table
      R1(A,D,C)   R2(D,B)
 
BCNF Example 2:
 
   R(Sn, Ln, Fn, Dn, Dc)
   Sn -> Ln, Fn, Dn, Dc [All others]
   Dn -> Dc

   R1(Sn,Ln, Fn, Dn)    R2(Dn, Dc)
